# Semester-Group-Project

Semester group project to build store using Python and SQL

INSTRUCTIONS:

the following packages must be installed
in the same environment the app is being run from:
1. PyQt6
2. mysql-connector-python

to begin, set up a connection through your MySQL Workbench
and run the_authletic_outlet_database.sql script to create
the database for the app to run off.

once this is done open the information.py file
and change the values in the USER and PASS variables to the username
and password you are using to access the database.
you can also change the HOST and PORT variables if the
database is being run on a remote server.

once this is done launch the app.py file and the GUI
should be functional, allowing you to view all the data on customer,
inventory, and invoices, and use the POS tab to 
create new invoices for customers.
